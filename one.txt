The Lion and The Clever Fox
A lion used to roam a deep woodland, but as he is growing old by passing each day, now he spends a lot of time in his den with his wife, waiting for visitors to see them. Due to illness, the lion was unable to get food. So, he used to eat the guests who came to see them.
One day his wife informed him in the morning that his breath was nasty and awful. Hearing that embarrassed and infuriated the lion. He wished to confirm this information with others. He, therefore, summoned three others from outside his cave.
The sheep arrived first. "Sheep, tell me if my mouth smells unpleasant," the lion asked, spreading his mouth wide. The sheep responded, "Yes, Friend," thinking that the lion desired an open response. Your breathing seems to be off in some way. The lion did not appreciate this straightforward language. The sheep was killed when he jumped on it.
The wolf was then called. The lion asked, "What do you think? Have I had a terrible breath? Wolf observed what transpired to the animals. He wanted to respond to a question with extreme caution. The wolf responded by asking, "Who says your breath is terrible? Its sweetness compares to that of flowers. The lion roared in rage at the response and launched an immediate attack, killing the wolf. The lion hissed, "The flatterer!"
It was the turn of the fox at last. The lion also questioned him. The fox was well aware of what had happened to the wolf and sheep. He continued to cough and clear his throat before stating, "Oh, Dear Friend, I have had a really nasty cold for the past few days. I am unable to smell anything because of this, good or bad.‚Äù The lion decided not to kill the fox.
